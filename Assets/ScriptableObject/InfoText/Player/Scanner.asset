  infoText: 'Antivirus software scans files for known malware signatures (unique
    code patterns).

    - Best for: Viruses or other malware that have static, detectable
    code are weak.

    - Bad for: Malware that uses polymorphic code (constantly
    changing) such as botnets.


    Heuristic analysis looks for suspicious behavior
    patterns (e.g., a file trying to encrypt system files).

    - Best for: Malware
    that has predictable behavior such as worm replication.
